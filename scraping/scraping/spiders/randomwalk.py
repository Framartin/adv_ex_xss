# This spider implement the sampling method of the Web described in Monika R. Henzinger, Allan Heydon, Michael Mitzenmacher, Marc Najork, On near-uniform URL sampling, Computer Networks, Volume 33, Issue 1, 2000, Pages 295-308.
# This is a random walk method with random jump. This is implemented as follows:
# 1. Randomly sample NOMBER_SELECTED_SEEDS domains/URL of URL_SEEDS without replacement
# 2. For each page:
#     a. make sure that this is an html page (using https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#htmlresponse-objects). If not select a new domain or a previously downloaded page and go to 2.
#     b. with probability d continue, with 1-d randomly select a new domain or a previously downloaded page and go to 2.
#     c. save the page
#     d. parse all the links (using scrapy.linkextractors, for example to not select ftp:// links)
#     e. randomly sample 1 link. If there is no link, select a new domain or a previously downloaded page and go to 2.
#     f. follow this link and go to 2.
# 3. Stop when we have saved CLOSESPIDER_ITEMCOUNT pages

# Becareful:
# 1. You have to filter out dupliacted HTML pages after crawling. Even if the spider strips out anchors in the URLs. Some URLs lead to the same page content (eg. parameters used for tracking).
# 2. Note that the URL are canonicalized in order to removed duplicated links (eg. links to the same page having different fragments: foo#1, foo#2): http://w3lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/w3lib.html#w3lib.url.canonicalize_url
# 3. To fully implement the paper cited below, you have to compute the pageRank of each page and include it in the final sample with a probability proportional to the reverse of the pageâ€™s rank. THIS IS NOT DONE BY THIS SCRIPT.

# TODO "Scrapy filters out duplicated requests to URLs already visited, avoiding the problem of hitting servers too much because of a programming mistake" https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html?highlight=duplicated
# TODO disable dupluacted request instead of dont_filter argument
