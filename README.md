## Scraping Data

**Important:** If you want to skip this part, you can reuse the data published here: [xssed_data.7z](https://github.com/Framartin/adv_ex_xss/releases/download/v0.1.0/xssed_data.7z) and [randomwalk_subsample.7z](https://github.com/Framartin/adv_ex_xss/releases/download/v0.2.0/randomwalk_subsample.7z).

### Configuration

Please edit `scraping/scraping/settings.py@19` to identify yourself.

### Getting the Alexa top sites list

If the source file is not available anymore, use the `top-100000.csv` included in this repository. Data were generated the `2017-07-18 12:51:20.000000000 -0400`.

```
cd scraping/alexa
wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip && \
unzip top-1m.csv.zip && \
head -100000 top-1m.csv > top-100000.csv

stat -c %y top-1m.csv # time of last modification of the top 1 million
#2017-07-25 12:52:54.000000000 +0000
rm top-1m.csv
cd ..
```

### Executing scrapy

```
scrapy crawl xssed -o xssed.json --logfile log_xssed.txt --loglevel INFO

# number of malicious observations
wc -l xssed.json # minus 2 for the first and last lines
#38637 xssed.json
```

Edit the `custom_settings` at `scraping/scraping/spiders/randomwalk.py@72` before using the randomwalk spider. Among others settings, it's important to set `CLOSESPIDER_ITEMCOUNT` which defines the number of benign web pages to save. We recommend to scrape more benign data than malicious ones: 

- to plan the deletion of duplicated pages
- to perform a posterior (uniform) random sample

```
scrapy crawl randomwalk -o randomwalk.json --logfile log_randomwalk.txt --loglevel INFO
```


Note: if you encounter the error `OSError: [Errno 24] Too many open files:` in the log, try `ulimit -n 30000` (this modification only applies to the current session).

### Remove oversized files

Some files are just too big.

```
find html/ -size +50M -exec ls -lh {} \+
```

For example, `html/xssed/full/7aee06aa9087469b5766a8b8d27194a41e2e51c0` that weights 193Mio!

```
rm html/xssed/full/7aee06aa9087469b5766a8b8d27194a41e2e51c0
```

### Remove broken mirrored pages

The following files don't mirrored the html pages, but provide a screenshot of the pages instead. This is useless. See one example [here](http://vuln.xssed.net/2015/03/12/library.leeds.ac.uk/).

```
cd html/xssed
grep -r '^<html><body><img src="screenshot.jpg">$'
rm full/ea9eee5557b1541ae7a91963800d0e65e297afbe full/886c40189b6c2b23d4622f3b4a8bb4837b90dd46 full/d0d6cb0807e4a05fd9907e409335a48769546424
```

### Remove duplicated files

We need to filter duplicated HTML files download from the random walks. See `scraping/scraping/spiders/randomwalk.py` for more informations.

```
cd html/randomsample/full/
fdupes -r . # see duplicated files by groups
fdupes -rf . | grep -v '^$' > ../duplicated_randomsample_files.txt
less ../duplicated_randomsample_files.txt # check files
xargs -a ../duplicated_randomsample_files.txt rm -v # delete files
cd ../../..
```

### Sampling benign pages

You can create a sample of the web pages scraped from the random walk: 

1. You can choose to perform a Random Sample in which the probabilities of each observation is inversely proportional to its pagerank (see _Monika R. Henzinger, Allan Heydon, Michael Mitzenmacher, Marc Najork, On near-uniform  URL sampling, Computer Networks, Volume 33, Issue 1, 2000, Pages 295-308._). This is not implemented here (for simplicity and because the sample is small).
2. Perform a Uniform Random Sample:

```
ls -1 html/xssed/full | wc -l # number of malicious observations
#38627
N=50000 # set the number of benign pages to keep

cd html/randomsample

mkdir subsample
ls -1 full/ | python -c "import sys; import random; print(''.join(random.sample(sys.stdin.readlines(), int(sys.argv[1]))).rstrip())" $N | while read line; do cp "full/$line" subsample; done
# adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/a/33509190
```

You can choose to backup all downloaded files, before removing all html pages not in the subsample.

```
# Be careful to be on the randomsample folder!
rm -r full 
```


## Parsing HTML files to generate features

```
python3 generate_data.py > log_generate_data.txt
ls -lh data.csv
```
